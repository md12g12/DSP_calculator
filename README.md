Dyson Sphere Program (DSP) is a factory game similar to Factorio, where the player crafts ever more complicated items using previous items as components. (https://dsp-wiki.com/Main_Page) 

Calculating the total resources for a given item requires a recursive script to find all the components of the components of the components...

This is a simple python script that when given an item name returns all the basic resources and components needed for the full crafting recipe.
